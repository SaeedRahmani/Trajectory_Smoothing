# Trajectory_Smoothing
Different Methods to Smoothen the Vehicle Trajectories based on Waymo and Lyft datasets

## How to use
I've put some trajectories from Lyft and Waymo. You can test the algorithms just by referring to the correct file. Good Luck!

## Thanks
Thanks to Zhenlin (Gavin) Xu for providing the pickle files and the outlier removal algorithm.
